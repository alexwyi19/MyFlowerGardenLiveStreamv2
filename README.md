# Requirements

# Features
- **Saving and Loading Billing** - Save your billing information to a JSON File and load the billing directly from the file.

- **Dark and Light UI Theme** - Easy to use user interface with all setup options on the same pane along with a dark theme. 
- **Keyword Finder, auto add to cart and checkout** - Bot will find the keywords for each task, add the product to the cart and try and checkout, Current for EU only. 
- **Multi threaded** - Support for multiple tasks at the same time to cop multiple items.

After installation you want to load the bot up and add your billing information under File > Profile Editor. 

Then you can set up a task on  left panel of the main bot. Keywords should be whole separated with spaces, no commas or 
other symbols. Keywords can be found [here](https://supremecommunity.com)

Select the desired category the item will be in, do not use the *new* category, size and colour. Use the Browser mode for now
as the Requests still needs finishing.

Input localhost in the proxy field, edit the number of tasks if you wish to do so, use the Default Profile and click create Task. 

Supreme drops at 11:00:00 GTM On Thursday so you want to start tasks at this 5-10 seconds before, Browser instances will launch
which are visible and will attempt to automate the checkout process.

### Disclaimer: Please keep in my mind this bot is still in beta and there might be bugs here and there in this case raise a issue and i will try fixing them. Also if anyone wants to help with development as this is a community project feel free to create a pull request.
